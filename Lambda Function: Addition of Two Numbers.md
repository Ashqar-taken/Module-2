# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

f = lambda x,y : x + y

print(f(a,b))
```
## Output

## Result
A python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments 'a' and 'b' and returns their sum is written successfully.
